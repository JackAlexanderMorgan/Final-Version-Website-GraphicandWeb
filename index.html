                    <img src="Images\CARP\Carp1.jpg" alt="CARP Poster 1">
                </a>
                <p><h3>Design 1</h3></p>
                <p class="image-description">This was my first design. It utilises contrast in how the black and white text contrasts with the brightly coloured background. Alignment is used when pushing most of the the text to the right while having the dates and the price tag angled in contrast to one another. Repetition is used in the repeating colours shadowing the title and the image of the skateboarder. Finally, I've used proximity by grouping the related pieces of information with one another in order of importance. In my opinion, the rainbow-coloured shadows are the best elements of this poster. Overall, this is my least favourite of all the designs as the way I structured the elements together doesn't read very well. It isn’t clear where the viewer should be looking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="collection-item">

                </a>
                <p><h3>Design 2</h3></p>
                <p class="image-description">This second design is a clear improvement on the last. I believe this is because the information is structured in a way that makes it easier to read. The primary source of contrast is the dark image of the skateboarder against the bright background. Repetition is clearly used in the graphic I made for the background. The header and skateboarder are also aligned while the less important information split between the bottom two corners - contrasting the upper half of the poster. I have used proximity by grouping relevant chunks of information with one another while maintaining the information hierarchy. I like the use of imagery in this poster, and I feel the font used for the title relates well to the theme. If I was to develop this poster further, I would rethink the background as it feels too simple and cheapens the rest of the poster. </p>

                </a>
                <p><h3>Design 3</h3></p>
                <p class="image-description">The third poster I designed is the one we decided to develop further. This poster is the easiest to read with a clear flow of information. The colours used in the title and logo compliment the imagery well. The black and white text along with the price tag contrast against the background making it easily legible. The alignment of each element goes down from the top in a zigzagging pattern towards the bottom, this provides the user a clear path as to where their eyes should look next. Repeating themes can be found in the use of colour, and the styling of the boxes around each date of the event.</p>

                </a>
                <p><h3>Final Version</h3></p>
                <p class="image-description">The final developed version combines the main design of the third poster with some of my favourite elements from the others, such as the font from design two. I changed the position of the logo and the style of the main title so that the skateboarders face is visible, and the style is a more accurate representation of the sport it is advertising. The angle of the title contrasts in alignment with the dates the flow of information still clear. I'm very happy with this final result. If I was to start from scratch, I would probably try and make it look more like a poster than a magazine cover.</p>

                    <p><h3>Axial</h3></p>
                    <p class="image-description">Axial designs put everything on either side of a single line. That is exactly what I've done here. Each line of text alternates sides of the centre line while leaving a gap on the opposing side so that it is still clear how the reader should progress. </p>
            </div>

                    <p><h3>Bilateral</h3></p>
                    <p class="image-description">Bilateral designs are simply centre aligned. Due to the simple nature of this typographic system, I tried to make the information more interesting by making changes to the text rather than the layout. I've used heavier weightings and italics to emphasise and bring attention the more important aspects.</p>

                </a>
                    <p><h3>Dilatational</h3></p>
                    <p class="image-description">Dilatational designs are rings of text expanding from a central point. Each element has no obvious relationship. I comprised mine from multiple circles all curved in different directions. I included some primitive shapes to accentuate the design and make it more intriguing.</p>
            </div>

                    <p><h3>Grid</h3></p>
                    <p class="image-description">Grid telegraphic systems are where each body of text is separated into its own square container. When designing mine, I thought of a newspaper and tired to included equal gaps between each grid element.</p>

                </a>

                <p><h3>Modular</h3></p>
                <p class="image-description">Modular designs are similar to a grid layout in the fact that each body of texts inhabits its own individual field. The main difference being that you aren't as limited with what you can use as a container. When designing this, I tried to make it look as different as possible to the grid layout.</p>

                </a>
                    <p><h3>Radial</h3></p>
                    <p class="image-description">Radial typographic systems give the appearance of a central point "radiating" the words out - like beams of light from the sun. It's different from Dilatational as the text doesn't wrap around the circle, but instead branches out from it. The hardest part of creating this design was making the hierarchy of the text obvious.</p>

                </a>
                    <p><h3>Random</h3></p>
                    <p class="image-description">Random is self-explanatory. Each element is displayed randomly with no particular orientation or direction. Legibility and traditional design principles take a backseat when using this system. When designing this piece, I tried to make it look as interesting as possible rather than just throwing words at a page.</p>

            <div class="collection-item">

                </a>
                    <p><h3>Transitional</h3></p>
                    <p class="image-description">Transitional is the most interesting of the typographic systems. Each line of text is unique and seemingly unrelated to the previous one. When viewed as a whole, the piece is supposed to give the illusion of motion - looking like a sea of waves, or layers of sediment. When drawing lines for text to follow, I wanted each one to be unique, but simultaneously look as if an imprint had been left by the weight of the line above.</p>

            <p class="reflect">I found these coding worksheets a useful refresher to my pre-existing HTML and CSS knowledge. It also brought to my attention some design tools I wasn’t previously familiar with, such as buttons changing on click. I found it helpful how they were distributed at weekly intervals rather than just given as one assignment. If it had just been one long task, it likely would have felt insurmountable to many due to each sheet taking a decent amount of time to get through. The end products the worksheets produced served as a useful database to refer to if stuck when coding my own website. The primary benefit I found from using these worksheets was familiarising myself with the process of using GitHub.</p>

<!--REFLECTIVE ESSAY SECTION-->

        <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
        <div class="reflective-content">
            <h3>My Reflection</h3>
            <p class="reflect">Looking back on this project as a whole, I'm happy with how it turned out. To begin with I thought it would be overwhelming. I got the impression it would entail more work than there actually was. I started out intimidated due to there being five projects to complete for just this one module. Also, I wasn't clear on how much work each project would involve - other than the website, which I knew would be a lot. As the weeks progressed, each project was introduced one at a time. This gradual introduction made the workload easier to manage, especially when attending every lecture as this would provide plenty of time to get work done. 
                <br><br>The most significant aspect of this project was the creation of the website itself. This was an ongoing challenge throughout the entire duration of the module. Aside from the obvious struggles of getting code to work as intended, it was hard to build the website when I hadn't finished producing the content that would be contained within it. Drawing a wire frame for the website helped in this respect as it made visualising the final layout easier. Despite this, things still needed to be adjusted when introducing the content as things wouldn't always go to plan or function as intended. 
                <br><br>Having previously studied both Graphic Design at college, and Software Engineering for one year at university, I already had experience with most things being taught within this module. I found the main benefits were expanding upon my existing knowledge on how to use tools such as Adobe illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. When creating the layouts for typographic systems, it forced me to learn new tools and techniques I hadn't used before. The requirement to use InDesign for producing the CARP posters made me enhance my skills in programmes I would otherwise avoid due to preferring alternative options. This has broadened my horizons with graphic design, as I previously didn't appreciate InDesign’s value.  
                <br><br>Another thing I learnt from this module was also in relation to the typographic systems. It introduced me to a whole range of ways to present text that I did not previously have knowledge of how to produce or how to communicate these ideas effectively. I believe creative use of typography is one of the most impactful forms of design, yet it is rarely executed in an interesting manner. Through using this knowledge in my future designs, it can help my work to stand out amongst the crowd. Furthermore, the coding worksheets served as a nice refresher to my HTML and CSS knowledge and also provided me with a few lines of code that I did not previously know.
                <br><br>Overall, I believe the content taught within this module does an effective job of providing students with a diverse range of skills. The work was challenging enough for it not to become mundane, but not so challenging that it would make the project too hard to complete. Had this been my first experience with the skills taught within this module, I still believe I would have been able to perform well as the delivery of the content was spaced out in a very manageable way. To finalise, I enjoyed this module and look forward to future projects.
